<b>Description:</b> I created this Android application as an integral component of my Senior Practicum Project demonstrating an affordable home automation system. This project iteration included an Android application, Python scripts, a Raspberry Pi, and connected sensors and lighting elements. We utilized <a href="https://www.pubnub.com/">PubNub</a> to transfer messages between the app and connected devices (across two channels for more reliable communication) to remotely perform operations such as RGB lighting control and temperature and humidity sensing.
